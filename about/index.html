      <h4>I'm a product designer living in Orlando, Florida. I'm currently leading design at <a href="https://streamyard.com">StreamYard</a>, a product that makes it easy for anyone to become a successful live streamer, all from the browser. Prior to that, I worked at <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a> shaping experiences for WordPress, a platform that powers more than 35% of the web.</h4>
      <p>I’m a human-centered, process-oriented, and results-focused designer. I begin every design project asking three fundamental questions: Who is the user? What problem(s) of theirs are we trying to solve? And what does the current data say? I find that deeply understanding the answers to those questions provides the necessary framing for the work that follows.</p>
      <p>Good design is intentional, focuses on the end user, and ultimately motivates people to take action. Good product design is a combination of devotion and empathy for customer needs (researching and connecting with the problems to be solved); good visual strategy (translating ideas well to actually solve those problems); and leadership (making signals from noisy inputs, building alignment and driving meaningful progress forward).</p>
      <p>On a personal level, I’m an avid thinker and doer. That inspires my ever-growing list of product, research, and writing projects. I value impact, effective execution and communication, introspection and personal growth, and engaging in behaviors that are good for me, good for others, and good for the world.</p>

        <h2>My design process</h2>
        <h4>Lean strategy</h4>
        <p>Build fast. Fail fast. Learn fast. The ultimate goal is to provide value for the user. The sooner we discover and achieve that, the better. I use hypothesis based problem solving to validate and measure the efficacy of ideas, as early and as often as possible. I work with teams to frame the work (outlining who the user is, the problem they're having, and how we plan to solve it), prototype the concepts, and then test those prototypes with real users. Once the concepts are viable, I help deliver them as proper solutions, and then measure their outcomes to determine impact and next steps. It is a repeating cycle that involves iteration and forward progress.</p>
        <h4>User research</h4>
        <p>To be truly human-centered means integrating with the people you’re solving problems for. Not just through observation and communication, but also through real, empathetic connection. Becoming immersed in what users are *doing, thinking,* and *feeling* affords much more effective and meaningful outcomes.</p>
        <p>The two methods I use most often are user interviews (to discover new opportunities and assess the value of current opportunities) and usability testing (to determine if and how well something works). As a requisite, I always seek to gain a deeper understanding of the persona(s) I'm connecting with and the problem(s) they’re facing. I also collect any additional quantitative and qualitative insights that might influence that understanding. From there, I outline a research plan, conduct the sessions, and then synthesize the learnings.</p>
        <h4>Problem framing and discovery</h4>
        <p>A solution without a problem isn’t a solution. To understand the problem(s) we’re looking to solve, for both the user and the business, the problem(s) needs definition. This is a cross-functional exercise (I like to have relevant stakeholders from various teams present) to help set focus and alignment throughout the course of development. At the start of every project, I have the following framed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who are the users (or business parts) were focused on?</li>
          <li>What problem of theirs are we going after?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Information architecture</h4>
        <p>Understanding hierarchy and flow is essential before any in-depth design work happens. My goal is to understand what is most important to the people using the product or feature. What needs to be communicated and in what priority? How do we get them from point A to D in the most efficient manner so they can effectively achieve their goals?</p>
        <h4>Sketching</h4>
        <p>Early on in the design process, I typically work through simple marker sketches to give enough of the concept to have a productive discussion. With this exercise, I’m mostly concerned with ensuring we’ve considered the appropriate cases and that were aligned on the overall experience, before we get caught up in visual details. Once aligned, I transition immediately to high fidelity mock-ups and prototypes.</p>
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>I’m a proponent of high fidelity early on in the process (design systems and tools are making this a lot easier for us to do nowadays). Using and feeling something is much different than just looking at it and talking about it. The more real that experience is, where you can interact with it like the end-product, the better the conversations and insights, especially when you can get it in the hands of actual users.</p>
        <h4>Usability testing</h4>
        <p>Organizing and conducting user testing is one of the most exciting aspects of my role. Particularly when the prototype is 1:1 with the end-product experience, you get the first real glimpse into whether your assumptions and approach to the solution are promising and viable.</p>
